## Problem statement :
The problem with today's youngest generation is that they have become so addicted to mobile phones that they want one as their own. They learn to use these devices even before they learn to write alphabets.


## Proposed solution :
this app helps to learn children alphabets.When everything is digitalizing, and children are even having their own devices, this app can make learning fun for then as they see many colors and pictures and will be good to remember things.
